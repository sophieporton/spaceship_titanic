# Spaceship Titanic

This repository contains code and data related to the "Spaceship Titanic" project, likely a data science or machine learning project focused on predicting passenger transport based on data from the fictional Spaceship Titanic.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features to improve model performance.
*   **Model Fitting:** Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models for passenger transport prediction.
*   **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaning and preparation of the raw data for analysis and modeling.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before running the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** (Version 3.6 or higher recommended)
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For running the `.ipynb` files.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
*   **Seaborn:** For enhanced data visualization.
*   **Pandas Profiling:** For generating detailed data analysis reports.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas-profiling
```

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sophieporton/spaceship_titanic.git
    cd spaceship_titanic
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies** (as described in the Prerequisites section).

3.  **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If a requirements.txt file existed.
    ```

## Usage Examples

The repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the key steps involved in this project:

*   **EDA.ipynb:** This notebook performs exploratory data analysis on the dataset. Run this notebook to understand the data and identify potential features.

*   **Data pre-processing.ipynb:** This notebook handles the pre-processing steps to prepare the data for model training.

*   **Feature engineering.ipynb:** This notebook demonstrates how to create new features from the existing data.

*   **Model fitting.ipynb:** This notebook trains and evaluates machine learning models using the prepared data and engineered features.

*   **Pandas profiling test.ipynb:** Uses the `pandas-profiling` library to automatically generate a comprehensive report on the dataset.

Open these notebooks using Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
